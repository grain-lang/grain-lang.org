      Meet Grain's co-creator, Oscar. In 2017, Oscar, excited about WebAssembly's
      possibilities, co-created Grain, an easy-to-use, flexible but functional
      language that made adoption of WebAssembly simple for the world's
      developers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Known for his problem solving and optimism, Oscar is a Principal Engineer
      at F5 NGINX, ...

      Oscar specializes in compilers, language design, OCaml, and functional
      programming. When he's not working, find him on Discord or mulling over the
      next big challenge.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Who he admires: Guido van Rossum, creator of Python, a language that
      developers adore, with a welcoming community.

      Supportive and bold, Marcus is a champion for building teams who develop
      self-sufficiently. His goal for Grain is simple: a language with easy step
      up, easy development, and a full set of tooling essential for today's
      developers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marcus was responsible for building Grain's language server that provides
      code analysis for code editors.

      Currently, Marcus works as the Technical Director at Nittygritty, where he
      leads both the technical services part of the company and a software
      development team.

      Josiah's first experience with Grain was figuring out how to integrate it
      into a WebAssembly game runtime. Since that time, he's focused on
      implementing the core primitives of the standard library. He expects Grain
      will be a popular language for microcontrollers, smart contracts, APIs,
      gaming, and UI development.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Josiah is currently a full stack software engineer at Phantom, where he
      works to improve performance across the app.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Josiah plays bass guitar and has been known to write a song and produce
      music from time to time. But mostly, he just codes a lot and drinks coffee.
