          Connect with us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/grain-lang" class="underline">Discord</a>!
          We'll walk through contributor opportunities with you, and we're even
          glad to do a pair programming session to get you up to speed. We'll go
          over how to get involved and teach you anything you need to know, even
          if you've never touched a compiler or worked on a programming language.
