## Writing Your First Grain Program

It's time to write your first Grain program! While simple, this program should verify that we have everything set up correctly.

### The File Extension

All Grain files end with the extension `.gr`. Let's create our first file and call it `hello.gr`.

### The Code

The code for this program is fairly straightforward and should feel familiar from other languages.

```grain
// hello.gr
print("Hello, world!")
```

### Running the Program

To run the program, we use the Grain CLI:

```bash
grain hello.gr
```

If everything is set up properly, we should see the message appear in the console.
