title: Built-in Types
---

Grain provides some built-in types to be used throughout your programs.

### **Bool**

```grain
enum Bool {
  true,
  false
}
```

The type of Grain booleans, i.e. the type of `true` and `false`.

### **Char**

```grain
type Char
```

The type of Grain Unicode characters, i.e. `'g'`, `'ðŸŒ¾'`, `'ðŸ’»'`.

### **String**

```grain
type String
```

The type of Grain strings, i.e. `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."`.

### **Bytes**

```grain
type Bytes
```

The type of Grain byte sequences.

### **Void**

```grain
enum Void {
  void
}
```

The type of `void`, also known as "unit" or "nothing".

### **Option**

```grain
enum Option<a> {
  Some(a),
  None
}
```

The type of Grain options (i.e. `Some(1)` or `None`). The `a` is the type of the value. This is useful for functions that might return `None` instead of a value.

### **Result**

```grain
enum Result<t, e> {
  Ok(t),
  Err(e)
}
```

The type of Grain results (i.e. `Ok(1)` or `Err("Something went wrong")`). The `t` and `e` are the types of the value and error, respectively. This is useful for functions that might fail, and is the type of the `Result` module.

### **Array**

```grain
type Array<a>
```

The type of Grain arrays, i.e. `[> 1, 2, 3]`. Arrays are fixed-length and allow for efficient get/set operations at any index.

### **List**

```grain
type List<a>
```
The type of Grain lists (linked lists), i.e. `[1, 2, 3]`. Lists are immutable and allow for values to be efficiently appended.

### **Box**

```grain
type Box<a>
```

The type of Grain boxes. Boxes are wrappers that allow the internal data to be swapped during execution.

# **Rational**

```grain
type Rational
```

The type of Grain rationals, i.e. `2/3r`. Rationals are represented as a numerator and denominator.

### **Number**

```grain
type Number
```

The type of Grain numbers, i.e. `42`, `0x2a`, `23.19`, `2/3`. Grain numbers can be arbitrarily large integers, floats, or rationals.

### **BigInt**

```grain
type BigInt
```

The type of arbitrarily large integers, i.e. `42t`, `9_223_372_036_854_775_808t`.

### **Int8**

```grain
type Int8
```

The type of 8-bit integers, i.e. `127s`, `-127s`, `0x01s`.

### **Uint8**

```grain
type Uint8
```

The type of 8-bit unsigned integers, i.e. `255us`, `42us`, `0x01us`.

### **Int16**

```grain
type Int16
```

The type of 16-bit integers, i.e. `32768S`, `-32768S`, `0x01S`.

### **Uint16**

```grain
type Uint16
```

The type of 16-bit unsigned integers, i.e. `65535uS`, `42uS`, `0x01uS`.
### **Int32**

```grain
type Int32
```

The type of 32-bit integers, i.e. `42l`, `0x2al`.

### **Uint32**

```grain
type Uint32
```

The type of 32-bit unsigned integers, i.e. `42ul`, `0x2aul`.

### **Int64**

```grain
type Int64
```

The type of 64-bit integers, i.e. `42L`, `0x2aL`.

### **Uint64**

```grain
type Uint64
```

The type of 64-bit unsigned integers, i.e. `42uL`, `0x2auL`.

### **Float32**

```grain
type Float32
```

The type of 32-bit floating-point numbers, i.e. `3.5f`.

### **Float64**

```grain
type Float64
```

The type of 64-bit floating-point numbers, i.e. `3.5d`.

### **Exception**

```grain
type Exception
```

The type of Grain exceptions. Exceptions represent errors that have occured in a program.
