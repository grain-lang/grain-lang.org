Welcome to the Grain docs! Here you'll find information about the language, the standard library, and officially supported tools. If you're brand new to Grain, we highly recommend starting with [the Grain guide](/docs), where you can have a tour of the language and make sure you're all set to write some code.

## Getting additional help

If something isn't making sense or you have more questions, reach out in the `#support` channel on the [Grain Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/grain-lang). There are a bunch of friendly folks happy to help out.
