        Meet Grain's co-creator, Oscar. In 2017, Oscar, excited about WebAssembly's
        possibilities, co-created Grain, an easy-to-use, flexible but functional
        language that made adoption of WebAssembly simple for the world's
        developers.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Known for his problem solving and optimism, Oscar is a Principal Engineer
        at F5 NGINX.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Oscar specializes in compilers, language design, OCaml, and functional
        programming. When he's not working, find him on Discord or mulling over the
        next big challenge.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Who he admires: Guido van Rossum, creator of Python, a language that
        developers adore, with a welcoming community.

        Supportive and bold, Marcus is a champion for building teams who develop
        self-sufficiently. His goal for Grain is simple: a language with easy step
        up, easy development, and a full set of tooling essential for today's
        developers.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Marcus was responsible for building Grain's language server that provides
        code analysis for code editors.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Currently, Marcus works as the Technical Director at Nittygritty, where he
        leads both the technical services part of the company and a software
        development team.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        On any given Friday night, you can find Marcus drinking a craft beer and
        surfing the web. He hasn't found the end yet.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        His biggest ask: That you stand to the right on the London Underground
        escalators. Seriously.
