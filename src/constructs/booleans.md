title: Booleans
---

The `Boolean` type is an enum of the values `true` and `false`. Unlike other enums, `true` and `false` use a special lowercase syntax.

```grain
true
```

```grain
false
```

Grain does not have a concept of "truthiness" as the only truthy value in Grain is `true`, and the only falsy value is `false`.
