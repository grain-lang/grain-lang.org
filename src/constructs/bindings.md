## `let`, `let mut`, and `let rec`

The `let`, `let mut`, and `let rec` statements introduce new names into the current scope.
In other words, they let you create variables that can be used throughout your programs.

`let` and `let rec` both create **immutable** bindings, which means they cannot be reassigned to new values once declared.

The `let mut` statement can be used to create **mutable** bindings, which means that those names can be reassigned to new values.

## Syntax

```grain
let name1 = value1 [, name2 = value2]
let rec name1 = func1 [and name2 = func2]
let mut name1 = value1 [, name2 = value2]
```

### Parameters

`name1`, `name2`, ..., `nameN`
Names to be used for the binding identifiers.

`value1`, `value2`, ..., `valueN`
Any valid Grain expression.

`func1`, `func2`, ..., `funcN`
Any valid Grain functions.

## Description

* `let` allows you to introduce new names with values that never change. In other words, `let` allows you to create **immutable** variables.
* `let mut` allows you to introduce names with values that can change. In other words, `let mut` allows you to create **mutable** variables.
* `let rec` allows you to declare recursive functions.

### Using `let`

Using `let` is pretty simple:

```grain
// Assigning the value 5 to the name `foo`
let foo = 5

// Assigning the value of name `foo` to name `bar`
let bar = foo

// Assigning this function to the name `add2`
let add2 = (a, b) => a + b

// Assigning the result of this block to the name `baz`
let baz = {
  let a = 5;
  let b = 6;
  a * b
} // baz is now the value 30
```


`let` is scoped to the nearest block. That really just means it's scoped to the nearest enclosing curly braces:

```grain
let a = {
  // This is allowed, since this `a` only exists within the enclosing braces.
  let a = 3;

  let b = 4;
  a + b
}

a // This evaluates to 7.

b // This is a name error, since `b` only existed in the earlier block.
```

### Using `let mut`

`let mut` allows you to declare bindings where the value may be changed in the future. Also provided are `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=` operators, which perform the math operation on a mutable value and reassign the result.

```grain
let mut b = "foo"

print(b) // "foo"

b = "bar"

print(b) // "bar"

let mut count = 7

count += 9
count -= 6
count *= 5
count /= 25

print(count) // 2
```

### Using `let rec`

`let rec` primarily allows you to define recursive functions.
The name of the identifier used will be within the scope of the body of the function:

```grain
let rec fib = (n) => {
  if (n < 2) {
    n
  } else {
    fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
  }
}
```

`let rec` also allows you to define mutually recursive functions:

```grain
let rec isEven = (n) => {
  if (n > 1) {
    isOdd(n-1)
  } else {
    n == 0
  }
},
isOdd = (n) => {
  if (n > 1) {
    isEven(n-1)
  } else {
    n == 1
  }
}
```
