Hey there. ðŸ‘‹

These past few years, building Grain and seeing our community grow has been an absolute blast. We've accomplished so much in just the past year, and there's no sign of us slowing down any time soon.

Today, I'm thrilled to announce the brand new Grain blog! ðŸŽ‰

We want to keep everyone following our journey up to date with what the Grain team is working on, as well as all of the major happenings in the WebAssembly community. You'll see solid content on Grain features, language design, our favorite (and least favorite) WebAssembly proposals, and much more.

It'll be a great source of essential WebAssembly nutrients and fiber, for sure!

Be sure to join our mailing list and [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/grain_lang) so you don't miss out on any of our updates.
