# Themes

Note: the "-converted" theme versions were generated from the base themes with this tool: https://github.com/Nishkalkashyap/monaco-vscode-textmate-theme-converter and then manually massaged a bit to make them work with `monaco-editor`

e.g. `npx monaco-vscode-textmate-theme-converter -i github-light.json -o github-light-converted.json`
